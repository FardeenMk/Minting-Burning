**CryptoToken**

The CryptoToken contract is a digital token implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, a programming language for smart contracts. This contract enables basic functions for managing tokens, including creating new tokens, burning existing ones, and transferring tokens between Ethereum addresses.

**Key Features:**

- **Minting Tokens:** The owner of the contract can create new tokens and allocate them to any Ethereum address.
  
- **Burning Tokens:** Any holder of tokens can destroy a specific amount of their tokens, reducing the overall token supply.
  
- **Transferring Tokens:** Holders of tokens can send tokens from their address to another Ethereum address.

**Usage:**

Once the CryptoToken contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the provided functions:

- **Minting:** If you're the owner of the contract, you can mint new tokens and assign them to any Ethereum address.
  
- **Burning:** Any token holder can burn a specific amount of their tokens, reducing the total token supply.
  
- **Transferring:** Token holders can transfer tokens from their address to another Ethereum address.

**License:**

The CryptoToken contract is released under the MIT License, which permits anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the contract.
